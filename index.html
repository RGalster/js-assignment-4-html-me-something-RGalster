         <p>The small French town of Sixt-Fer-a&#769;-Cheval, or "Sixt" as we would refer to it, sits in a river valley not far from the city of Geneva, Switzerland.  In mid June of 2019 I followed a work buddy who was leading a retreat and yoga teacher training course for a group of about 60 folks from all over the globe.  For two weeks my role was to provide some abient music for approximately 1 to 2 sessions per day.  It was an opportunity to collaborate with a small group of other musicians while also finding some time to work on my own yoga practice, sit in on some philosophy talks, and get to know all these yogis at their various stages of development.  In my free time I was able to take in a small portion of what this little wonderland had to offer.</p>

         <p>My lodgings were located a short hike uphill to the village of Salvagny.  Chalets were the norm, but there were also old stone buildings here and there like the Chapelle de Salvagny which dates back to 1619.  Hiking nearby I could get into the woods, along rocky stream beds, or under the mists of what seemed like limitless waterfalls.</p>

         <p>Eventually finding out about a "not to be missed" site in the area, I made my way to what's called the Cirque du Fer-a&#769;-Cheval.  Traveling up the valley brings you to this horseshoe shaped cluster of mountains;  the "Fer-a&#769;-Cheval" portion of the name translates to "horseshoe".  As you enter though, it would seem you're surrounded on <em>all</em> sides by the vast steep slopes of greenery, streams, waterfalls, and snowcapped rocky peaks.  On one hike, I had partnered up with someone from my group and I insisted that we make it to Le Bout du Monde; aka, "the End of the World".  This would be the place where you more or less have to turn back unless you're prepared and hopefully equipped to cross over the mountains and into the neighboring Swiss slopes.  Another attempt on another day had me up and along a carved trail to one of the refuges typically supplied by pack animal because of their remote location.</p>
